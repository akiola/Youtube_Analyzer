Welcome to this quick tutorial on installing TensorFlow version 2.14 on macOS 13.5, also known as Ventura, specifically tailored for Apple Mac MCHIP users. I'll be skipping the downloading process and unnecessary steps to get you up and running with TensorFlow as swiftly as possible. First things first, we need to make sure you have Xcode command-line tools installed. Open your terminal and enter the command below. Xcode select install. Don't worry if you see an error like command-line tools are already installed. It means you're good to go. In my video I've already installed Xcode command-line tools before recording. Next up we need Anaconda for the MCHIP version. You can download Anaconda from the link provided in the video description. Now let's install TensorFlow dependencies using the following command in your terminal. conda install c apple tensorflow deps. This sets the stage for our TensorFlow installation. To keep things clean we're creating a conda environment. I did this using the command conda create ntensorflow python 3.11. This isolates our TensorFlow setup. Now we'll install TensorFlow itself and some plugins. Use these commands pip install tensorflow macos pip install tensorflow metal. These are crucial for TensorFlow's performance on your Mac. As we prepare to test TensorFlow on your Mac MCHIP we're going to install some essential packages. These packages are like tools in your toolbox and while we're installing them for this demonstration keep in mind that for your own projects you'll install specific packages relevant to your needs. Now let's add these packages to your environment. conda install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn scipy plotly jupyter. While we're installing this package bundle for demonstration purposes remember that the beauty of Python and TensorFlow is the flexibility to tailor your environment to your unique project requirements. These packages are the building blocks of countless data science and machine learning projects. Let's proceed and see how TensorFlow performs with this toolkit at your disposal. If you encounter any issues during this process please leave a comment and I'll be more than happy to assist you. In my session I faced an error related to opening Python files in Jupyter Notebook. you To resolve this I ran conda install charde now let's ensure TensorFlow is configured correctly on your Mac MCHIP. We've come a long way let's make sure everything's in place. Open a Python file and use this code. If you encounter an error regarding TensorFlow Keras you version simply import Keras's separately as shown. And there you have it. You've successfully configured TensorFlow on your Mac MCHIP machine. you As you can see TensorFlow version 2.14 is up and running on Mac OS Ventura ready for your machine learning adventures. Feel free to leave comments or questions and I'll be here to assist. Thanks for watching.
